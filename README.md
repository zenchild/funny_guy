# FunnyGuy

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/funny_guy`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.


## HTTP Client

I have a pattern that I use often when talking to external APIs that has been quite flexible in the past. That code pattern shows up here in the `FunnyGuy::DataSource::HttpClient` class and the associated Middleware response handlers.
